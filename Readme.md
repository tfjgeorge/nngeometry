NNGeometry allows you to:
 - compute Gauss-Newton or **Fisher Information Matrices** (FIM), as well as any matrix that is written as the covariance of gradients w.r.t. parameters, using efficient approximations such as low-rank matrices, KFAC, EKFAC, diagonal and so on.
 - compute finite-width **Neural Tangent Kernels** (Gram matrices), even for multiple output functions.
 - compute **per-examples jacobians** of the loss w.r.t network parameters, or of any function such as the network's output.
 - easily and efficiently compute linear algebra operations involving these matrices **regardless of their approximation**.
 - compute **implicit** operations on these matrices, that do not require explicitely storing large matrices that would not fit in memory.

It offers a high level abstraction over the parameter and function spaces described by neural networks. As a simple example, a parameter space vector `PVector` actually contains weight matrices, bias vectors, or convolutions kernels of the whole neural network (a set of tensors). Using NNGeometry's API, performing a step in parameter space (e.g. an update of your favorite optimization algorithm) is abstracted as a python addition: `w_next = w_previous + epsilon * delta_w`.

## Example

In the Elastic Weight Consolidation continual learning technique, you want to compute $`\left(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}_{A}\right)^{\top}F\left(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}_{A}\right)`$. It can be achieved with a diagonal approximation for the FIM using: 
```python
F = FIM(model=model,
        loader=loader,
        representation=PMatDiag,
        n_output=10)

regularizer = F.vTMv(w - w_a)
```
The first statement instantiates a diagonal matrix, and populates it with the diagonal coefficients of the FIM of the model `model` computed using the examples from the dataloader `loader`.

If diagonal is not sufficiently accurate then you could instead choose a KFAC approximation, by just changing `PMatDiag` to `PMatKFAC` in the above. Note that it internally involves very different operations, depending on the chosen representation (e.g. KFAC, EKFAC, ...).
